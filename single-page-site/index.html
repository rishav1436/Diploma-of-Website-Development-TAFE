        Aussie Kidz Charity assists the families of children under the age of 18
        years old thatare diagnosed with a disability.After years of supporting
        various well known kids charities, Aussie Kidz Charity was started in
        early 2000 by a group of individuals disheartened by watching an
        increasing percentage of donations being used to cover overheads instead
        of going to the ones who need it most, the Kids.With Aussie Kidz
        Charity, 100% of the donations received are used for the children, with
        the running costs and overheads kept to an absolute minimum and looked
        after by the Directors and friends.
