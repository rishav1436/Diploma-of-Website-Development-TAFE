          Our History Aussie Kidz Charity was founded in 2000 by David Dahl and
          Ross Tisch. Both men were previously Directors of another children’s
          charity and were tired of seeing funds increasingly spent on overheads
          and not the children in need. They set up Aussie Kidz Charity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based in Brisbane Australia the Aussie Kids charity seeks to assist
          disabled and under priveledged kids across Australia. 100% of funds
          raised go directly to the children to help them with their needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          To date, Aussie Kidz has raised approximately $900 000 and has
          distributed these funds by way of 150 grants to kids in need. These
          funds have been used to purchase equipment and services for disabled
          and under- privileged children from all over Australia.
